<h1 class="ti"><strong>Grammar Analysis</strong></h1>

<h1><strong>Sentence Structure</strong></h1>
Milton uses complex sentences with multiple clauses, reflecting his reflective and meditative tone.<br>
The poem is divided into two sections:<br>
The octave (lines 1-8): Presents the problem, written as a single, extended sentence with multiple dependent clauses.<br>
The sestet (lines 9-14): Resolves the problem, starting with "But Patience" and offering reassurance.

<h1><strong>Use of Inversion</strong></h1>
Milton frequently uses inverted word order, typical of 17th-century poetry,<br>
to maintain rhythm and emphasize certain words. For example:<br>
"When I consider how my light is spent" (line 1) places "when I consider" at the beginning for a reflective tone.<br>
"Ere half my days, in this dark world and wide" (line 2)<br>
places "Ere half my days" before the main clause for emphasis.

<h1><strong>Use of Passive Voice</strong></h1>
Passive constructions highlight Milton's sense of helplessness and focus on divine will.<br>
Example: "That one talent which is death to hide" (line 3).

<h1><strong>Ellipsis</strong></h1>
Milton omits certain words for conciseness and to fit the metrical pattern. For example:<br>
"God doth not need / Either man’s work or his own gifts" (lines 9-10) omits auxiliary verbs for brevity.

<h1><strong>Personification</strong></h1>
Abstract concepts like "Patience" are personified, functioning as a subject with human qualities.<br>
Example: "But Patience, to prevent / That murmur, soon replies" (lines 8-9).

<h1><strong>Use of Questions</strong></h1>
The poem features rhetorical questions to express Milton's doubt and inner conflict.
Example: "Doth God exact day-labour, light denied?" (line 7).

<h1><strong>Parallelism</strong></h1>
Parallel structures are used for balance and emphasis.<br>
Example: "They also serve who only stand and wait"(line14), where "stand" and "wait" are parallel.

<h1><strong>Figurative Language</strong></h1>
Metaphor: "My light is spent" refers metaphorically to Milton’s lost eyesight.<br>
Allusion: References to the biblical parable of the talents.

<h1><strong>Conclusion</strong></h1>
Milton’s use of complex grammar, inverted word order,<br>
and rhetorical devices like personification and <br>
metaphor creates a contemplative and solemn tone.<br>
The grammar and syntax reflect his struggle with faith and resignation to God's will,<br>
making the poem both linguistically rich and emotionally powerful.<br>
