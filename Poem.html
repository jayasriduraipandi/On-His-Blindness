<header><h1>On His Blindness<br>-John Milton</h1></header>
<h2 class="poem">
When I consider how my light is spent<br>
Ere half my days in this dark world and wide,<br>
And that one talent which is death to hide<br>
Lodg'd with me useless, though my soul more bent<br>
To serve therewith my Maker, and present<br>
My true account, lest he returning chide,<br>
"Doth God exact day-labour, light denied?"<br>
I fondly ask. But Patience, to prevent<br>
That murmur, soon replies: "God doth not need<br>
Either man's work or his own gifts: who best<br>
Bear his mild yoke, they serve him best. His state<br>
Is kingly; thousands at his bidding speed<br>
And post o'er land and ocean without rest:<br>
They also serve who only stand and wait."
<br>
-John Milton
