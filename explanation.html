John Milton’s “On His Blindness” is a reflective sonnet in which the poet contemplates his blindness and its impact on his ability to serve God.<br>
He begins by lamenting the loss of his sight, which he metaphorically refers to as his "light,"<br>
and fears that he may fail to use his God-given talent. Drawing on the biblical parable of the talents,<br>
Milton expresses anxiety that his inability to produce creative work mightrender him unworthy in the eyes of God.<br> 
He questions whether God expects him to labor actively despite his physical limitations,<br>
conveying a deep internal conflict about purpose and divine expectation.<br>

The poem’s turning point comes with the personification of Patience,<br>
who reassures Milton that God does not require human labor alone.<br>
Instead, God values those who endure life’s burdens with faith and humility.<br>
Patience emphasizes that quiet acceptance and trust in God’s plan are as valuable as active service,<br>
leading to the famous conclusion: “They also serve who only stand and wait.”<br>
Through this resolution, Milton finds peace, realizing that his faith and willingness to submit to God’s will are sufficient forms of service.<br>
The poem ultimately conveys a universal message about finding purpose and grace in adversity.<br>
