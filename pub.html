            John Milton’s poem “On His Blindness” was likely composed around 1655<br>
            during his later years after he became completely blind.<br>
            However, the poem was not published as an individual work during his lifetime.<br>
            Instead, it was included posthumously in collections of his poetry.<br>

            <h1><strong>Publication History</strong></h1>
        
            <h1><strong>1. First Posthumous Publication (1673)</strong></h1>
            
            “On His Blindness” was first published as part of “Poems, etc.<br>
            upon Several Occasions”, a collection of Milton's sonnets and shorter works.<br>
            
            <h1><strong>2. Later Editions</strong></h1>
            
            The poem was subsequently included in “The Works of John Milton”<br>
            (various editions compiled in the 18th and 19th centuries).<br>
            It was classified under Sonnet XIX, as Milton did not originally title the poem “On His Blindness.”<br>
            This title was later attributed by editors to reflect the central theme of the poem.<br>
            
            <h1><strong>3. Modern Recognition</strong></h1>
            
            Over time, “On His Blindness” became one of Milton’s most anthologized and studied sonnets<br>
            celebrated for its universal themes of faith, patience, and divine service.<br>
