    </header>
    <body>
        "On His Blindness" by John Milton is a sonnet that reflects the poet's inner turmoil and eventual resolution regarding his blindness and his sense of purpose in life. <br>
        The poem is written in the form of a Petrarchan sonnet and explores themes of faith, patience, and divine service.

        <strong><h1>Summary</h1></strong>
The poem begins with Milton lamenting his loss of sight, which occurred during his middle age.<br>
 He reflects on how his blindness affects his ability to use his talent,<br>
 particularly his literary skills, to serve God.<br>
 He worries that his inability to produce creative work will render him useless and unworthy in the eyes of God.<br>
Milton personifies his "talent" as a gift from God, expressing concern that it might be wasted now that he is unable to use it effectively.<br> 
He questions whether God expects him to labor and produce despite his disability.<br>
The turning point comes in the second half of the poem, where Milton receives<br>
comfort through the personified figure of Patience, who reassures him.<br> Patience explains that God does not require active work from everyone; instead, God values those who bear their burdens with faith and trust. The famous concluding line, "They also serve who only stand and wait," emphasizes the idea that faith, acceptance, and inner devotion are equally valuable forms of service to God.

<h1><strong>Key Themes</strong></h1>
<br>
<strong>1. Faith and Trust in God:</strong> Milton learns to trust that God has a purpose for everyone,<br>
 even if it is not immediately clear.<br>
<strong>2. Acceptance of Limitations:</strong>The poem reflects the poet's journey toward accepting his blindness as part of God's plan.
<br>
<strong>3. Service to God:</strong> Milton explores the idea that serving God does not always require active labor but can also mean enduring hardships with grace and patience.
This sonnet is deeply personal, reflecting Miltonâ€™s struggle with his blindness and his ultimate reliance on faith to find peace and purpose.
